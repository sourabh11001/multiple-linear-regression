# Multiple Linear Regression using Python

This project focuses on building and evaluating a **Multiple Linear Regression** model to predict outcomes based on **two or more independent variables**. It’s a core concept in **Machine Learning** that extends the ideas of simple regression to capture more complex relationships in data.

---

## 🔍 Objective

To understand how multiple features collectively influence a target variable and how to build a regression model that generalizes well on unseen data.

---

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries Used

* **Python**
* **NumPy** and **Pandas** – for data manipulation and analysis
* **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** – for data visualization and correlation analysis
* **Scikit-learn** – for model training, prediction, and performance evaluation

## 📊 Project Workflow

1. **Data Import & Cleaning** – Load dataset, handle missing values, and preprocess features
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – Understand correlations between multiple variables
3. **Feature Selection** – Choose relevant independent variables for the model
4. **Model Training** – Train a Multiple Linear Regression model using Scikit-learn
5. **Prediction** – Predict continuous values based on input features
6. **Evaluation** – Use metrics like R² Score, MSE, and Adjusted R² for assessment
7. **Visualization** – Plot relationships and residuals to understand model fit

## 📈 Results

The model successfully predicts target values using multiple predictors, offering better accuracy compared to simple regression.
Example output: visualization of predicted vs actual values and regression diagnostics.

## 💡 Future Improvements

* Add **Polynomial Regression** or **Regularization (Ridge, Lasso)**
* Use **feature scaling** and **cross-validation**
* Apply on larger, real-world datasets for better generalization
